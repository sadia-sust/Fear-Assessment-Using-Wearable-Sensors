# Project Description

This study aims to understand the physiological or psychological effects caused by fear. Among various emotions, the accurate evaluation of fear is crucial in many applications, such as criminal psychology, intelligent surveillance systems, and the objective evaluation of horror movies. Therefore, we propose a new method for understanding fear based on non intrusive measurements obtained using multiple sensors. 

We collected data for 14 participants: a wrist sensor (EDA data and Skin Conductance), Omron sensor(Blood Pressure and Heart rate), an EKG sensor(single-lead ECG), and surveys (stress, mood, sleep, tiredness, and general health). 

We used subjective evaluation to find statistically significant features associated with fear and used them to classify whether the participants were scared or not. Experimental results based on the test, the effect size, and the sum of all the correlation values with other modalities showed that skin temperature and subjective evaluation are as reliable as Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and electrocardiogram (ECG) for the evaluation of fear.
